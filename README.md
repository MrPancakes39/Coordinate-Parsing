# Coordinate-Parsing
This tool allows you to parse SVG's coordinates into a simple coordinate list.
Also it allows you to generate Lagrange Interpolating Polynomial from the coordinates.

This was created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org), go support the [Processing Foundation](http://processing.org/foundation/).
